# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for AI Assistant

## System Role
Senior full-stack engineer building production-ready features with minimal complexity. Follow TDD, prefer server components, implement least-privilege RBAC, respect multi-tenancy.

## Project Overview
Drouple is a multi-church management system designed to handle:
- Sunday Check-In
- LifeGroups management
- Events coordination
- Discipleship Pathway tracking
- Members management
- Super Admin oversight across churches

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **PWA**: Native-like mobile experience with service worker, haptic feedback, and offline capabilities
- **Mobile**: 11+ mobile components with touch-optimized interactions and camera integration
- **Database**: Neon Postgres (pooled connections) + Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth v5 with JWT Credentials Provider
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit/component), Playwright (e2e)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub integration
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights for performance tracking

## Architecture Decisions
1. **App Router**: Using Next.js 15 App Router for better performance and DX
2. **Server Components**: Default to RSC, client components only when needed
3. **Database**: Neon Postgres with pooled connections and composite indexes for optimal performance
4. **Auth Strategy**: JWT with Credentials Provider (email + bcrypt password)
5. **Multi-tenancy**: User.tenantId field for church isolation with repository guard patterns
6. **Security**: Enhanced CSP policy, rate limiting with Redis fallback, comprehensive security headers
7. **Performance**: Bundle analysis monitoring, N+1 query prevention, database connection pooling
8. **DevOps**: Vercel deployment with GitHub integration, automated CI/CD pipeline
9. **PWA Architecture**: Native app shell with offline-first design, background sync, and push notifications
10. **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-optimized UI components with haptic feedback and safe area handling
11. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive analytics with Vercel Analytics (user behavior) and Speed Insights (Core Web Vitals)

## Development Workflow
1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Verify with `npm run test` and `npm run lint`
4. Update documentation as needed

## Key Patterns
- **RBAC Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN > CHURCH_ADMIN > VIP > LEADER > MEMBER
- **Tenant Isolation**: All queries filtered by tenantId with `createTenantWhereClause()` and `getAccessibleChurchIds()` guards
- **Server Actions**: Prefer server actions over API routes with standardized error response format: `{ success: boolean, data?: T, error?: string }`
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs with proper error boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries, Sentry monitoring, graceful degradation patterns
- **Performance**: Selective field fetching, composite database indexes, Redis-backed rate limiting
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading skeletons and error boundaries across all admin pages
- **API Versioning**: v1/v2 endpoints with proper deprecation headers for future-proof evolution

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for business logic
- Component tests for UI interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- PWA testing for mobile components and native features
- Service worker testing for offline functionality
- Run `npm run test` before commits

- Creates users with deterministic IDs for testing
- Test accounts:
  - Super Admin: `superadmin@test.com`
  - Church Admins: `admin.manila@test.com`, `admin.cebu@test.com`
  - Leaders: `leader.manila@test.com`, `leader.cebu@test.com`
  - Members: `member1@test.com` through `member10@test.com`

### Playwright Testing

- Auth fixtures: `superAdminAuth`, `churchAdminAuth`, `vipAuth`, `leaderAuth`, `memberAuth`
- Global setup runs seed before tests (password: `Hpci!Test2025` for all test accounts)
- Login uses explicit selectors (#email, #password) and flexible URL matching
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  import { test, expect } from './fixtures/auth'
  
  test('admin can access dashboard', async ({ page, churchAdminAuth }) => {
    await page.goto('/admin')
    await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toBeVisible()
  })
  ```
