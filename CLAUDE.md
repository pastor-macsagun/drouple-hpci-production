# CLAUDE.md - Project Context for AI Assistant

## System Role
Senior full-stack engineer building production-ready features with minimal complexity. Follow TDD, prefer server components, implement least-privilege RBAC, respect multi-tenancy.

## Project Overview
HPCI-ChMS is a multi-church management system designed to handle:
- Sunday Check-In
- LifeGroups management
- Events coordination
- Discipleship Pathway tracking
- Members management
- Super Admin oversight across churches

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Database**: Neon Postgres (pooled connections) + Prisma ORM
- **Auth**: NextAuth v5 with Email Provider via Resend
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit/component), Playwright (e2e)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Vercel deployment

## Architecture Decisions
1. **App Router**: Using Next.js 15 App Router for better performance and DX
2. **Server Components**: Default to RSC, client components only when needed
3. **Database**: Pooled connections for serverless compatibility
4. **Auth Strategy**: JWT with Credentials Provider (email + bcrypt password)
5. **Multi-tenancy**: User.tenantId field for church isolation

## Development Workflow
1. Write tests first (TDD)
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Verify with `npm run test` and `npm run lint`
4. Update documentation as needed

## Key Patterns
- **RBAC Roles**: SUPER_ADMIN > CHURCH_ADMIN > LEADER > MEMBER
- **Tenant Isolation**: All queries filtered by tenantId except SUPER_ADMIN
- **Server Actions**: Prefer server actions over API routes
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly messages

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for business logic
- Component tests for UI interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Run `npm run test` before commits
- Run `npx playwright test` for e2e validation

### Test Scripts
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests once
- `npm run test:unit:watch` - Run unit tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:unit:coverage` - Run unit tests with coverage report
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run Playwright e2e tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run Playwright with UI mode
- `npm run test:e2e:ci` - Run Playwright in CI mode
- `npm run test:all` - Run both unit and e2e tests

### CI/CD Testing
- GitHub Actions runs tests on push/PR to main/develop branches
- Separate jobs for unit tests (with coverage) and e2e tests
- HTML reports stored as GitHub artifacts (30 day retention)
- Coverage thresholds: 50% for statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Flake-resistant with retries (2x in CI) and testIdAttribute support

## Security Considerations
- Environment variables for secrets
- RBAC enforcement at data layer
- Input validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma
- XSS protection built into React

## Performance Goals
- Lighthouse score > 90
- Server components by default
- Optimistic updates where appropriate
- Database query optimization
- Edge caching via Vercel

## Design System (Updated Aug 24, 2025)
- **Color Palette**: Sacred Blue (#1e7ce8) + Soft Gold (#e5c453) 
- **Tokens**: CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, typography, shadows, z-index
- **Base Components**: Header (with dark mode), Sidebar (collapsible), PageHeader, AppLayout
- **Patterns**: EmptyState (modernized), DataTable, ListItem, Spinner/LoadingCard
- **Utilities**: Responsive container, focus styles, status badges, gradient text
- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode support via next-themes, system preference detection
- **Mobile**: Responsive grids, touch-friendly targets, drawer navigation
- **Documentation**: Full redesign details at docs/ui-redesign.md

## Testing

### Database Seeding
- `npm run seed` - Reset and seed database with test data
- Creates users with deterministic IDs for testing
- Test accounts:
  - Super Admin: `superadmin@test.com`
  - Church Admins: `admin.manila@test.com`, `admin.cebu@test.com`
  - Leaders: `leader.manila@test.com`, `leader.cebu@test.com`
  - Members: `member1@test.com` through `member10@test.com`

### Playwright Testing
- Stable auth fixtures with UI-based login and storage state caching
- Auth fixtures: `superAdminAuth`, `churchAdminAuth`, `vipAuth`, `leaderAuth`, `memberAuth`
- Global setup runs seed before tests (password: `Hpci!Test2025` for all test accounts)
- Login uses explicit selectors (#email, #password) and flexible URL matching
- Example usage:
  ```typescript
  import { test, expect } from './fixtures/auth'
  
  test('admin can access dashboard', async ({ page, churchAdminAuth }) => {
    await page.goto('/admin')
    await expect(page.getByRole('heading')).toBeVisible()
  })
  ```
