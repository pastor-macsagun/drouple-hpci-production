RBAC & TENANT ISOLATION VALIDATION RESULTS
==========================================

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

üî¥ CRITICAL: TENANT ISOLATION BROKEN
   - Manila admin can see ALL 20 members (including Cebu members)
   - Cebu admin can see ALL 20 members (including Manila members)
   - Expected: Manila admin should see only ~7 Manila members
   - Expected: Cebu admin should see only ~7 Cebu members
   - Impact: Complete breakdown of multi-tenant security

üî¥ CRITICAL: ROLE-BASED REDIRECTS BROKEN  
   - All roles redirect to /dashboard instead of role-specific pages
   - NextAuth redirect callback only handles SUPER_ADMIN correctly
   - ADMIN, VIP, LEADER roles all fallback to dashboard
   - Impact: Users can't access their intended role interfaces

üü° MEDIUM: LIFE GROUP VISIBILITY ISSUES
   - Manila admin cannot see expected Manila life groups
   - Life groups appear to have filtering problems

POSITIVE FINDINGS:

‚úÖ Middleware Protection Works:
   - Unauthenticated access properly redirected to /auth/signin
   - Role-based path protection functional

‚úÖ Super Admin Access:
   - Super admin can access all tenant data (expected behavior)
   - Church filter dropdown present for super admin

‚úÖ VIP Access:
   - VIP users can access /vip/firsttimers page
   - Role-specific functionality accessible

‚úÖ Services Tenant Filtering:
   - Manila admin sees Manila services only
   - Cebu admin cross-tenant access blocked

DETAILED TEST RESULTS:

1. TENANT ISOLATION:
   ‚ùå Manila admin sees: 20 members (should see ~7)
   ‚ùå Cebu admin sees: 20 members (should see ~7)  
   ‚úÖ Cross-tenant service access blocked
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Direct entity URL access allowed (potential issue)

2. ROLE REDIRECTS:
   ‚ùå Super admin ‚Üí /dashboard (should be /super)
   ‚ùå Admin ‚Üí /dashboard (should be /admin)
   ‚ùå VIP ‚Üí /dashboard (should be /vip)  
   ‚ùå Leader ‚Üí /dashboard (should be /leader)

3. PATH PROTECTION:
   ‚úÖ Middleware correctly protects admin paths
   ‚úÖ Role-based access control functional
   ‚úÖ Unauthenticated users properly redirected

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

1. Tenant Isolation:
   - Membership filtering not implemented in admin queries
   - Database queries missing localChurchId filters
   - User.tenantId field not being used for isolation

2. Role Redirects:
   - NextAuth redirect callback incomplete (lib/auth.ts:153-165)
   - Only SUPER_ADMIN case handled, others fall through to dashboard

SECURITY IMPACT:
- HIGH: Complete tenant data exposure 
- MEDIUM: Role confusion due to incorrect landing pages
- LOW: Direct URL access needs validation

STATUS: üî¥ CRITICAL SECURITY DEFECTS FOUND
