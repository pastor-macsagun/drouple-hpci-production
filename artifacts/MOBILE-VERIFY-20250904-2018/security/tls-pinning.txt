Certificate Pinning Configuration Analysis:

1. Configuration Found: Yes
   Location: app.config.js line 195
   Implementation: certificatePinning: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE_PINNING === 'true'

2. Implementation Status: CONFIGURED (environment variable controlled)
   - Uses environment variable EXPO_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE_PINNING
   - Enabled when set to 'true'
   - Production builds should have this enabled

3. Verification Method: Config-based validation
   - Configuration present and properly structured
   - Runtime validation would require certificate verification testing
   - Production deployment should enforce certificate pinning

SUMMARY: Certificate pinning configuration VERIFIED in app.config.js
Runtime testing would require actual network requests with invalid certificates
