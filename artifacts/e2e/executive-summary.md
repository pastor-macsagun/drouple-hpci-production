- Middleware prevents unauthorized route access
- Proper role hierarchy: SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > VIP > LEADER > MEMBER
- Authentication redirects work correctly by role

### XSS & Security Headers
- ✅ **100% validated** - Enhanced CSP without 'unsafe-eval'
- Input sanitization via Zod schemas active
- React built-in XSS protection confirmed
- Security headers properly configured

### Rate Limiting
- ✅ **100% validated** - Redis-backed protection against brute force
- Environment-configurable limits active
- Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable
