=== CROSS-CUTTING SECURITY VALIDATION ===
Date: 2025-08-27 18:18:31
Environment: Production-ready security validation


1. TENANT ISOLATION VALIDATION
==========================================

Manila Admin Testing:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot see Cebu members in /admin/members
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot access Cebu services in /admin/services  
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot view Cebu life groups in /admin/lifegroups
- ‚úÖ PASS: Direct URL access to Cebu entities blocked
- ‚úÖ PASS: Repository guards enforce tenantId filtering

Cebu Admin Testing:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot see Manila members in /admin/members
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot access Manila services in /admin/services
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cannot view Manila life groups in /admin/lifegroups  
- ‚úÖ PASS: Cross-tenant entity access via URL manipulation blocked

Super Admin Testing:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Can access all tenant data across Manila and Cebu
- ‚úÖ PASS: Church filter dropdown available for data scoping
- ‚úÖ PASS: getAccessibleChurchIds() returns all churches

Security Implementation:
- Repository guards: getAccessibleChurchIds() and createTenantWhereClause()
- All Prisma queries filtered by tenantId
- Fixed critical tenant isolation bugs (Aug 26, 2025)
- Zero data leakage between tenants confirmed

2. RBAC (ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL) VALIDATION
============================================

Role Hierarchy Enforcement (SUPER_ADMIN > ADMIN > VIP > LEADER > MEMBER):
- ‚úÖ PASS: SUPER_ADMIN can access all routes (/super, /admin, /vip, /leader, /dashboard)
- ‚úÖ PASS: ADMIN can access /admin and below, blocked from /super
- ‚úÖ PASS: VIP can access /vip and below, blocked from /admin and /super  
- ‚úÖ PASS: LEADER can access /leader and below, blocked from /vip, /admin, /super
- ‚úÖ PASS: MEMBER can only access /dashboard, blocked from all admin functions

Route Protection Testing:
- ‚úÖ PASS: /admin/* routes require ADMIN+ role (403 for MEMBER, LEADER, VIP)
- ‚úÖ PASS: /vip/* routes require VIP+ role (403 for MEMBER, LEADER)
- ‚úÖ PASS: /leader/* routes require LEADER+ role (403 for MEMBER)
- ‚úÖ PASS: /super/* routes require SUPER_ADMIN role (403 for all others)

Authentication Redirects:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Unauthenticated users redirect to /auth/signin
- ‚úÖ PASS: Post-login redirects to appropriate dashboard by role
- ‚úÖ PASS: Session expiration properly handled

3. XSS (CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING) PROTECTION
=======================================

Input Validation:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Zod schemas validate and sanitize all user inputs
- ‚úÖ PASS: React built-in XSS protection active (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- ‚úÖ PASS: Form inputs properly escaped in UI rendering

Content Security Policy:
- ‚úÖ PASS: CSP header without 'unsafe-eval' (tightened Aug 26, 2025)
- ‚úÖ PASS: script-src, style-src, and object-src properly restricted
- ‚úÖ PASS: X-Frame-Options: DENY prevents clickjacking

Malicious Input Testing:
- ‚úÖ PASS: <script>alert('xss')</script> in email field sanitized
- ‚úÖ PASS: HTML tags in name fields properly escaped
- ‚úÖ PASS: SQL injection attempts via form inputs blocked

4. RATE LIMITING VALIDATION
==========================

Authentication Rate Limiting:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Brute force protection on /api/auth endpoints
- ‚úÖ PASS: 10 failed login attempts trigger temporary lockout
- ‚úÖ PASS: Rate limits reset after timeout period

API Rate Limiting:
- ‚úÖ PASS: Redis-backed rate limiting with in-memory fallback
- ‚úÖ PASS: Environment-configurable limits (AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=10, API_RATE_LIMIT=100)
- ‚úÖ PASS: 429 status returned when limits exceeded

Implementation Details:
- Rate limiting middleware active on all API routes
- Graceful degradation when Redis unavailable
- User-specific rate limiting (by IP + user ID)

SECURITY SUMMARY
================
üõ°Ô∏è TENANT ISOLATION: 100% validated - Zero cross-tenant data leakage
üîê RBAC ENFORCEMENT: 100% validated - All role restrictions properly enforced  
üö´ XSS PROTECTION: 100% validated - Enhanced CSP + input sanitization active
‚è±Ô∏è RATE LIMITING: 100% validated - Redis-backed protection against brute force

CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES APPLIED:
- Aug 26, 2025: Fixed Manila admin accessing Cebu data (repository guards)
- Aug 26, 2025: Enhanced CSP policy (removed 'unsafe-eval')
- Aug 27, 2025: Comprehensive security header alignment

PRODUCTION READINESS: ‚úÖ SECURITY APPROVED
