   - **Timeline:** Before launch

2. **Health Endpoint Cold Start**
   - **Current:** 4+ second initial response
   - **Impact:** Monitoring timeouts possible
   - **Fix:** Implement endpoint warming
   - **Timeline:** Week 1 post-launch

### P3 - Low Priority

   - **Routes:** `/admin` and `/admin/pathways` return 404
   - **Impact:** Minor UX issue
   - **Fix:** Add index pages or redirects
   - **Timeline:** Next sprint

2. **Rate Limit Headers**
   - **Current:** No `X-RateLimit-*` headers
   - **Impact:** Clients can't implement backoff
   - **Fix:** Add standard headers
   - **Timeline:** Next release
