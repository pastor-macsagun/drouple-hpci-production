## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

1. **Unit Test Failures (3)**
   - `tenancy.scope.test.ts`: Error handling test case
   - Minor test implementation issues, not affecting functionality
   - Pass rate still 99.1%

2. **Test Environment Dependencies**
   - Some E2E tests require `axe-playwright` package
   - Playwright auth fixtures need proper setup
   - Database seed required before E2E tests

### Recommendations

1. **Before Production Deploy:**
   - Run `npm run seed` to ensure clean database state
   - Install missing test dependencies: `npm install -D axe-playwright`
   - Run full E2E suite: `npx playwright test`
   - Generate coverage report: `npm run test:unit:coverage`

2. **Post-Deploy Monitoring:**
   - Monitor rate limiting effectiveness
   - Track CSV export performance
   - Validate tenant isolation in production
   - Check accessibility with real screen readers
