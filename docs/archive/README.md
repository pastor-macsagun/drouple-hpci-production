## Consolidation Summary

As of August 27, 2025, **24 redundant files** were archived to eliminate:
- **Documentation redundancy** - Multiple files covering the same topics
- **Outdated information** - Historical reports no longer reflecting current system state
- **Poor organization** - Files scattered across root and docs directories
