## Executive Summary

### Project Execution Overview
This execution plan operationalizes the Drouple Mobile App PRD into a actionable 6-month delivery framework. The plan emphasizes **risk mitigation**, **quality delivery**, and **stakeholder alignment** while maintaining the proven engineering standards established by the web platform.

### Key Execution Principles
- **Quality First**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage and zero critical bugs at launch
- **User-Centric**: Continuous validation with real church users throughout development  
- **Risk-Aware**: Proactive identification and mitigation of technical and business risks
- **Iterative Delivery**: Working software in user hands every 2 weeks
- **Stakeholder Transparency**: Regular communication with clear metrics and progress updates

### Success Metrics
- **Timeline**: Deliver MVP within 6 months with <10% schedule variance
- **Quality**: Launch with 95%+ test coverage, <0.1% crash rate, 4.5+ store rating
- **Adoption**: Achieve 70% of web users adopting mobile within 3 months post-launch
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second app launch, offline-first architecture working 95% of the time

  // Sync when online
  async syncToServer(): Promise<SyncResult>
  
  // Conflict resolution
  async resolveConflicts(): Promise<void>
  
  // Data freshness management  
  async refreshData(entityType: string): Promise<void>
}
```

#### **Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
// Performance Tracking
const performanceConfig = {
  // App launch metrics
  appLaunch: { target: 2000, threshold: 3000 }, // milliseconds
  
  // Network request metrics
  apiResponse: { target: 500, threshold: 1000 }, // milliseconds
  
  // UI responsiveness
