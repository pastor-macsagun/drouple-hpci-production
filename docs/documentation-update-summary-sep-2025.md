# Documentation Update Summary - September 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation updates completed on September 5, 2025, to reflect the current state of Drouple as a web-only church management system following the mobile application removal and cleanup.

## Context

During production readiness verification, the entire mobile application (drouple-mobile) and all related mobile API endpoints were removed from the project. This required updating all documentation to accurately reflect the current web-only architecture and remove outdated mobile references.

## Current Project Status

**Drouple** is now exclusively a **Next.js 15 web application** that is **production-ready** with:
- **Build Status**: ✅ Production build working correctly
- **TypeScript**: ✅ All type checks passing  
- **Unit Tests**: ✅ 662 tests passing (increased from 569)
- **Database**: ✅ Seeding working correctly
- **E2E Tests**: ⚠️ Timeout issues under investigation
- **Environment**: ✅ Simplified .env.example for web-only setup

## Files Intentionally Preserved

The following categories of files were **not** updated to preserve historical accuracy and context:

### Historical Documentation
- Archive files (already in `/docs/archive/`)
- Verification reports with historical data
- Sprint completion summaries with original context
- Performance and audit reports

### Technical Documentation  
- Files where "HPCI-ChMS" represents historical project name context
- Files with appropriate mobile references (responsive design practices)
- Configuration and troubleshooting guides that remain technically accurate

## Environment Configuration Status

### Updated .env.example ✅
The environment configuration has been simplified to include only variables used by the web application:

**Required Variables**:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT signing secret
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application base URL

**Optional Variables**:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Email notifications
- `REDIS_URL` - Enhanced rate limiting  
- `ENABLE_2FA` - Two-factor authentication
- Various monitoring/alerting URLs

## Current System Architecture

### Web-Only Next.js Application
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and App Router
- **Database**: Neon Postgres with pooled connections
- **Authentication**: NextAuth v5 with JWT credentials
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components  
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Production Features
- Multi-tenant church management

## Next Steps

1. **E2E Test Investigation**: Resolve timeout issues in end-to-end tests
2. **Continuous Documentation**: Update documentation as features evolve
3. **User Feedback**: Incorporate feedback to improve documentation clarity
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continue tracking system performance and optimization opportunities

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Outcomes ✅
