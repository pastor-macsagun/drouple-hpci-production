## Architectural Assessment

### ✅ **Data Model Completeness**
```sql
-- Core Models Present and Properly Indexed:
LifeGroup (id, name, leaderId, capacity, localChurchId, isActive)
LifeGroupMembership (unique: lifeGroupId + userId, status tracking)
LifeGroupMemberRequest (unique: lifeGroupId + userId + status)
LifeGroupAttendanceSession (unique: lifeGroupId + date)
LifeGroupAttendance (unique: sessionId + userId)

-- Proper Indexes:
- lifeGroupId, userId for fast lookups
- localChurchId for tenant isolation
- status fields for filtering
- date fields for chronological ordering
```

### ✅ **Business Logic Implementation**
- **Multi-Group Membership**: Users can belong to multiple groups simultaneously
- **Capacity Management**: Hard limits enforced with atomic transactions
- **Request Workflow**: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED with audit trail
- **Attendance Sessions**: Date-based sessions with individual member tracking
- **Leadership Model**: Single leader per group with delegation to admins

### ✅ **Performance Optimizations**
- **Query Optimization**: Selective field fetching, composite indexes
- **Pagination Support**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Efficient Counting**: Separate optimized count queries for capacity checks
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations for data consistency
