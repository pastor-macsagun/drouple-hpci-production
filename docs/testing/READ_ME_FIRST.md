# HPCI-ChMS Testing Guide - READ ME FIRST

**Last Updated:** August 27, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready - Comprehensive Testing Suite Active  
**Test Coverage:** 569 unit tests + Comprehensive E2E scenarios

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ with npm
- PostgreSQL database connection

### Run the Full Production Readiness Suite
```bash
# Complete 4-phase verification (as done for production approval)
npm run ship:verify              # Runs all quality gates
npm run test:all                # Both unit and E2E tests
npm run security:audit          # Security vulnerability scan
npm run performance:analyze     # Bundle analysis
```

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit               # Run once
npm run test:unit:watch         # Watch mode for development
npm run test:unit:coverage      # With coverage report

# E2E tests only  
npm run test:e2e                # Standard run
npm run test:e2e:ui             # Interactive UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ci             # CI-optimized run

# Database setup for testing
npm run seed                    # Reset and seed test data
npm run seed:verify             # Verify seed data integrity
```

## The 4-Phase Production Readiness Process

Based on our successful production verification completed on August 27, 2025, here's how to replicate the comprehensive validation:

### Phase 0: Build Quality Gates ‚öôÔ∏è
**Ensures code quality and builds successfully**

```bash
npm install                     # Install dependencies
npm run typecheck              # TypeScript validation (0 errors required)
npm run lint                   # ESLint validation (0 warnings required)  
npm run build                  # Next.js build (must succeed)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 0 TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ 0 ESLint warnings  
- ‚úÖ Build completes successfully
- ‚úÖ Bundle size under 200kB threshold

### Phase 1: Automated Test Suites üß™
**Validates business logic and integration**

```bash
npm run test:unit:coverage     # Unit tests with coverage report
npm run coverage:summary       # Print coverage summary
npm run test:e2e:ci           # E2E smoke tests (CI mode)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 95%+ unit test pass rate (569/582 achieved)
- ‚úÖ 50%+ code coverage maintained
- ‚úÖ E2E smoke tests pass in CI environment
- ‚úÖ No critical test failures

### Phase 2: Scenario E2E Testing üé¨
**Validates real-world user workflows**

```bash
npm run seed                   # Reset to deterministic test data
npm run test:e2e              # Full E2E scenario suite
```

**Scenarios Tested:**
- Authentication & role-based access (5 scenarios)
- Sunday Check-In system (5 scenarios) 
- LifeGroups management (5 scenarios)
- Events system with RSVP/waitlist (5 scenarios)
- Discipleship Pathways (5 scenarios)
- VIP/First-Timer management (5 scenarios)
- Member Management CRUD (5 scenarios)
- Cross-cutting security validation (4 scenarios)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 100% scenario pass rate (39/39 achieved)
- ‚úÖ All tenant isolation verified
- ‚úÖ All RBAC enforcement confirmed
- ‚úÖ Performance under 2s per operation

### Phase 3: Cross-Cutting Audits üîç
**Validates security, performance, and production readiness**

```bash
npm run security:audit         # Dependency vulnerability scan
npm run performance:analyze    # Bundle analysis
npm run db:health             # Database connectivity check
npm run monitoring:test       # Alert system verification
```

**Audit Areas:**
- Security: CSP policy, XSS protection, SQL injection prevention
- Performance: Bundle size, N+1 queries, connection pooling
- Tenant Isolation: Cross-church data leakage prevention
- RBAC: Role-based access control enforcement
- Data Integrity: Database constraints and referential integrity

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ 0 critical security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ 0 high-priority security issues
- ‚úÖ Bundle size optimization maintained
- ‚úÖ Database performance thresholds met

## Test Environment Setup

### Database Configuration
```bash
# For local development testing
npm run db:test:up             # Start test database (Docker)
npm run test:prepare           # Migrate and seed test DB
npm run db:test:down           # Clean up test database

# For production-like testing
npm run seed                   # Use main database with test data
npm run seed:verify            # Verify data consistency
```

### Authentication Test Users
All test users have password: `Hpci!Test2025`

| Role | Email | Access Level |
|------|-------|-------------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | superadmin@test.com | All churches, all features |
| ADMIN (Manila) | admin.manila@test.com | Manila church admin |
| ADMIN (Cebu) | admin.cebu@test.com | Cebu church admin |
| VIP | vip.manila@test.com | VIP team member |
| LEADER | leader.manila@test.com | LifeGroup leader |
| MEMBER | member1@test.com | Basic member access |

### E2E Test Configuration

**Playwright Configuration:**
```bash
# Run specific test files
npx playwright test auth                    # Authentication tests
npx playwright test admin                   # Admin functionality
npx playwright test super-admin            # Super admin features

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium     # Chrome only
npx playwright test --project=webkit       # Safari only

# Debug mode
npx playwright test --debug                # Interactive debugging
npx playwright test --trace=on            # Generate traces
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Failures

**Unit Test Timeouts:**
```bash
# Increase timeout for slow tests
TIMEOUT=10000 npm run test:unit

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run src/app/admin/members/actions.test.ts
```

**E2E Test Failures:**
```bash
# Reset test state
npm run seed

# Run with UI for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Generate detailed reports
npm run test:e2e -- --reporter=html
```

**Database Issues:**
```bash
# Reset database schema
npm run db:push -- --force-reset

# Verify database connection
npm run db:health

# Check migration status
npm run db:status
```

### Performance Issues

**Slow Tests:**
```bash
# Run tests in parallel (default)
npm run test:unit

# Run sequentially for debugging
npm run test:unit -- --no-parallel

# Profile test performance
npm run test:unit -- --reporter=verbose
```

**Memory Issues:**
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run test:all
```

### Environment Issues

**Missing Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Verify environment setup
npm run env:sanity

# Check required variables
cat .env.example
```

**Build Issues:**
```bash
# Clean build cache
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# Check bundle analysis
npm run analyze
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Database connection established and healthy
- [ ] Test data seeded and verified
- [ ] No pending git changes (clean working directory)
- [ ] All dependencies installed (npm ci recommended)
- [ ] Previous test artifacts cleaned up

**Quick Pre-Check:**
```bash
npm run env:sanity && npm run db:health && npm run seed:verify
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the logs**: Test artifacts are generated in `/artifacts/`
2. **Review documentation**: See [docs/troubleshooting-guide.md](../troubleshooting-guide.md)
3. **Verify environment**: Run `npm run env:sanity`
4. **Reset test state**: Run `npm run seed`
5. **Check recent changes**: Review git status and recent commits

## What's Next

After successfully running tests locally:

1. **Review test reports** in `/artifacts/` directory
2. **Check the production readiness checklist** (see next document)
3. **Run the full verification suite** before any deployment
4. **Monitor performance** and adjust thresholds as needed
