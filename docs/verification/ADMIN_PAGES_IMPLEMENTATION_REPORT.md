## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Server Components**: Default for data fetching
- **Client Components**: Only for interactivity
- **Server Actions**: All data mutations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **Error Handling**: Try/catch with user feedback

### Security
- **RBAC**: Role checks at action level
- **Tenant Isolation**: Filtered queries
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas (where applicable)
- **SQL Injection**: Prevented via Prisma
- **XSS Protection**: React default escaping

### Performance
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based for scalability
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback
- **Server Rendering**: Fast initial load
- **Caching**: Next.js built-in with revalidation
