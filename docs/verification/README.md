## Recent Security Fixes Applied

### 1. CRITICAL: Tenant Isolation Failure - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue**: Manila admins could access Cebu church data
- **Fix**: Repository guard functions `getAccessibleChurchIds()` and `createTenantWhereClause()`
- **Impact**: Complete data separation now enforced at database level

### 2. MAJOR: Role-Based Redirect Failure - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue**: All users redirected to `/dashboard` regardless of role
- **Fix**: Updated NextAuth redirect callback for all user roles
- **Impact**: Users now land on correct role-specific pages

### 3. MINOR: Test Stability Issues - RESOLVED ✅
- **Issue**: Modal selector conflicts in E2E tests
- **Fix**: Added stable `data-testid` attributes to forms and modals
- **Impact**: Improved test reliability and security validation

## Technology Stack Verification

### Core Technologies ✅
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.1.3 with App Router and Server Components
- **Runtime**: Node.js v24.6.0, npm v11.5.1
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM 6.14.0
- **Authentication**: NextAuth v5 with credentials provider
- **Testing**: Vitest 2.1.9 (unit) + Playwright 2.1.9 (E2E)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components

### Architecture Patterns ✅
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Church-based data isolation
