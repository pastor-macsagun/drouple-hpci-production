## ðŸ”„ Production Backend Switch

### Current State

The app is configured with **smart environment switching**:

- **Development**: Uses mock APIs (`EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_APIS=true`)
- **Production**: Uses real backend APIs (`EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_APIS=false`)

### Backend Integration Points

#### 1. Authentication Service

```typescript
// File: src/lib/api/backendServices.ts
export const authBackendService = {
  async login(credentials): Promise<ApiResponse<LoginResponse>>
  async logout(): Promise<ApiResponse<void>>
  async getProfile(): Promise<ApiResponse<UserProfile>>
  // ... other auth methods
}
```

#### 2. Core Services Ready

- **Events Service** - `/events` endpoints with RSVP management
- **Check-in Service** - `/services` endpoints with QR code validation
- **Life Groups Service** - `/groups` endpoints with membership management
- **Discipleship Pathways** - `/pathways` endpoints with progress tracking

#### 3. Production API Client Features

- **Certificate Pinning** - SSL security for API communications
- **Offline Queue** - Request queuing with automatic retry
- **Rate Limiting** - Configurable request throttling
- **Caching** - Intelligent response caching with TTL
- **Analytics Integration** - Request tracking and error reporting

## ðŸš€ Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Configuration

#### Set Production Environment Variables:

```bash
# Core Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MOCK_APIS=false
APP_VARIANT=production
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.drouple.com

# Security
EXPO_PUBLIC_CERTIFICATE_PINNING=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENCRYPT_STORAGE=true

SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
AMPLITUDE_API_KEY=your-amplitude-key

# Build Configuration
EXPO_PUBLIC_BUILD_NUMBER=1
ANDROID_VERSION_CODE=1
IOS_BUILD_NUMBER=1
```

### 2. Backend API Requirements

Your backend needs to implement these endpoints:

#### Authentication

- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /auth/logout` - Session termination
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `GET /auth/profile` - User profile
- `PATCH /auth/profile` - Update profile

#### Events Management

- `GET /events` - List events with pagination
- `GET /events/:id` - Event details with RSVP stats
- `POST /events/:id/rsvp` - Create RSVP
- `DELETE /events/:id/rsvp` - Cancel RSVP
- `GET /events/rsvps` - User's RSVP history

#### Check-in System

- `GET /services/today` - Today's services
- `POST /services/:id/checkin` - Manual check-in
- `POST /services/validate-qr` - QR code validation
- `POST /services/checkin-qr` - QR code check-in

#### Life Groups

- `GET /groups` - Available groups with filters
- `GET /groups/:id` - Group details
- `POST /groups/:id/join` - Join request
- `GET /groups/my-groups` - User's groups

#### Discipleship Pathways

- `GET /pathways` - Available pathways
- `POST /pathways/:id/enroll` - Pathway enrollment
- `GET /pathways/enrollments` - User's enrollments
- `POST /pathways/enrollments/:id/steps` - Complete step

### 3. API Response Format

All endpoints should return responses in this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Optional message",
  "pagination": { ... } // for paginated responses
}

// Error responses:
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": { ... }
}
```

### 4. Security Implementation

#### JWT Authentication

- Access tokens with 15-minute expiry
- Refresh tokens with 7-day expiry
- Secure token storage with encryption
- Automatic token refresh on 401 responses

#### Certificate Pinning

Configure SSL certificates in `src/lib/security/certificatePinning.ts`:

```typescript
pins: [
  {
    hostname: 'api.drouple.com',
    fingerprints: [
      'sha256/YOUR-CERTIFICATE-FINGERPRINT-HERE',
      'sha256/BACKUP-CERTIFICATE-FINGERPRINT-HERE',
    ],
  },
];
```
